Majestic and formidable, the sperm whale reigns as the largest toothed predator in the ocean. Its massive head, comprising a third of its body length, houses the largest brain of any creature on Earth. Diving to depths of over 3,000 meters, it hunts elusive giant squid in the inky blackness of the deep sea. With each powerful click of its echolocation, the sperm whale navigates and communicates, painting a vivid acoustic picture of its mysterious underwater world.
